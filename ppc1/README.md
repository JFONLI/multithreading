# Checkpoint 1

For this programming project checkpoint, you are to write a cooperative multithreading package (as presented during the week 6) and a test case based on the single-buffer producer-consumer example.  Cooperative multithreading means the code for each thread needs to explicitly do a thread-yield (not to be confused with Pythonâ€™s generator-yield) in order to switch to another thread, if any.

For this assignment, we will use a relatively simple threads API, as defined in cooperative.h.

### Data types
* typedef char ThreadID; where a ThreadID is a type for thread ID.  It is represented by a single byte, which is the native word size for 8051.
* typedef void (*FunctionPtr)(void);  a FunctionPtr is a type for a function pointer, for the purpose of attaching code to a thread.  SDCC compiles it to a 2-byte pointer (assumed to be code space).

### API
* ThreadID ThreadCreate(FunctionPtr);  This is the primary API for creating (and starting) a thread, and return its thread ID.  Once created, the thread is eligible to run.
* void ThreadYield(void);  This is the API for a thread to yield its control to another thread, if any.  Later, it can resume control immediately after the ThreadYield() statement.
* void ThreadExit(void);  This is the code for a thread to exit itself either explicitly or implicitly so that the resources can be recycled for another thread. For now we will not use it, but we will use it in a later assignment.

This cooperative threads package makes the following assumptions:
* Use of the four register banks on 8051 for each of the four threads. R0-R7 gets mapped to addresses 0x00-0x07, 0x08-0x0F, 0x10-0x17, 0x18-0x1F, depending on PSW bits <4:3>.
* Use of four 16-byte stacks at locations 0x40-0x4F, 0x50-0x5F, 0x60-0x6F, and 0x70-0x7F for threads 0-3. 
* manually allocated memory in the range 0x20-0x3F

## testcoop.c
###  <b>main + test case for cooperative multithreading</b>
Write the code for testcoop.c, which sets up the startup code and defines main() to set up the producer and consumer.  Here is the template for testcoop.c; Look for the @@@ in the comments for the code to fill out.

```
/* 
 * file: testcoop.c

#include <8051.h>
#include "cooperative.h"

/* 
 * @@@ [2pt] 
 * declare your global variables here, for the shared buffer 
 * between the producer and consumer.  
 * Hint: you may want to manually designate the location for the 
 * variable.  you can use
 *        __data __at (0x30) type var; 
 * to declare a variable var of the type
 */ 


/* [8 pts] for this function
 * the producer in this test program generates one characters at a
 * time from 'A' to 'Z' and starts from 'A' again. The shared buffer
 * must be empty in order for the Producer to write.

void Producer(void) {
        /*
         * @@@ [2 pt]
         * initialize producer data structure, and then enter
         * an infinite loop (does not return)
         */
        while (1) {
                /* @@@ [6 pt]
                 * wait for the buffer to be available, 
                 * and then write the new data into the buffer */
        }
}

/* [10 pts for this function]

 * the queue and consume it and writes it to the serial port.

                 */
        }
}

           * @@@ [1 pt] initialize globals 
           * @@@ [4 pt] set up Producer and Consumer.

## cooperative.c
Write the code that implements the cooperative multithreading API above.  In addition to the API functions, you need to define the thread bootstrapping function.

```
#include <8051.h>

#include "cooperative.h"

/*

 *        __data __at (address) type name; syntax
 * manually allocate the addresses of these variables, for
 * - saved stack pointers (MAXTHREADS)
 * - current thread ID
 * - a bitmap for which thread ID is a valid thread; 
 *   maybe also a count, but strictly speaking not necessary
 * - plus any temporaries that you need.
 */

/*
 * @@@ [8 pts]
 * define a macro for saving the context of the current thread by
 * 1) push ACC, B register, Data pointer registers (DPL, DPH), PSW
 * 2) save SP into the saved Stack Pointers array
 *   as indexed by the current thread ID.
 * Note that 1) should be written in assembly, 
 *     while 2) can be written in either assembly or C
 */
#define SAVESTATE \
        { __asm \
          @@@ your code here\
         __endasm; \
        }

/*
 * @@@ [8 pts]
 * define a macro for restoring the context of the current thread by
 * essentially doing the reverse of SAVESTATE:
 * 1) assign SP to the saved SP from the saved stack pointer array
 * 2) pop the registers PSW, data pointer registers, B reg, and ACC
 * Again, popping must be done in assembly but restoring SP can be
 * done in either C or assembly.
 */
#define RESTORESTATE \
         { __asm \
           @@@ your code here \
          __endasm; \
         }


 /*

         *
         * @@@ [18 pts] below
         * a. update the bit mask 
             (and increment thread count, if you use a thread count, 
              but it is optional)
           b. calculate the starting stack location for new thread
           c. save the current SP in a temporary
              set SP to the starting location for the new thread
           d. push the return address fp (2-byte parameter to
              ThreadCreate) onto stack so it can be the return
              address to resume the thread. Note that in SDCC
              convention, 2-byte ptr is passed in DPTR.  but
              push instruction can only push it as two separate
              registers, DPL and DPH.
           e. we want to initialize the registers to 0, so we
              assign a register to 0 and push it four times
              for ACC, B, DPL, DPH.  Note: push #0 will not work
              because push takes only direct address as its operand,
              but it does not take an immediate (literal) operand.
           f. finally, we need to push PSW (processor status word)
              register, which consist of bits
               CY AC F0 RS1 RS0 OV UD P
              all bits can be initialized to zero, except <RS1:RS0>
              which selects the register bank.  
              Thread 0 uses bank 0, Thread 1 uses bank 1, etc.
              Setting the bits to 00B, 01B, 10B, 11B will select 
              the register bank so no need to push/pop registers
              R0-R7.  So, set PSW to 
              00000000B for thread 0, 00001000B for thread 1,
              00010000B for thread 2, 00011000B for thread 3.
           g. write the current stack pointer to the saved stack
              pointer array for this newly created thread ID
           h. set SP to the saved SP in step c.
           i. finally, return the newly created thread ID.

## Notice
You should use the following two commands (Note: $ is the prompt displayed by the shell and is not part of the command that you type.)  The first one deletes all the compiled files so it forces a rebuild if you have compiled before. The second one compiles it.

```
$ make clean
$ make
```

It should show actual compilation, warning, or error messages.  Note that not all warnings are errors.  The compiler should generate several testcoop.* files with different extensions:
* the .hex file can be opened directly in EdSim51
* the .map file shows the mapping of the symbols to their addresses after linking
